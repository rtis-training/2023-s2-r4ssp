## Is this for me?

- I want to learn about R
- I'm a student or staff member at the University of Otago

If you answered yes to both questions, this course is for you!

This course is primarily targeted to students with no or little programming experience who want to learn R for their assignments or research projects. Staff are welcome to attend too.

## Content

This course is designed to provide many avenues to learning R. We have provided both Modules that give more in-depth information on topics and handouts, which are representative of the content that will be covered in the online sessions. Both resources are designed to be complementary to each other.

We have split the content into two common purposes for learning R

- Using R for data analysis
- Programming using R

The main motivation for many people is to perform data analysis, so we have structured the order so that people can 'get stuff done' and then learn about how to improve their efficiency using R.
